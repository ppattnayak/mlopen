## Catch Me If You Can: Intruder Detection through Webpage Session Tracking
### Finding Alice

Web-user identification is a hot research topic on the brink of sequential pattern mining and behavioral psychology.

Here we try to identify a user on the Internet tracking his/her sequence of attended Web pages. The algorithm to be built will take a webpage session (a sequence of webpages attended consequently by the same person) and predict whether it belongs to Alice or somebody else.

The data comes from Blaise Pascal University proxy servers. Paper "A Tool for Classification of Sequential Data" by Giacomo Kahn, Yannick Loiseau and Olivier Raynaud.
